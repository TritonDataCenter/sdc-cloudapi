 * Guard an endpoint based on `config.bleeding_edge_features` and

 *
 * Usually, you want to call this function within the `mount` function for
 * your resource as part of the "before" chain for any end-point you want to
 * guard. It's to say, this function must be called before the one which
 * actually performs your end-point logic. For example, for a new feature
 * called "very_latest", handled by a function called "endPoint" which will
 * be mounted on the route "GET /:account/end-point":
 *
 * server.get({
 *      path: '/:account/end-point',
 *      name: 'EndPointToBeTested',
 *      version: ['7.9.9']
 * }, bleedingEdgeGuard(config, 'very_latest'), before, endPoint)
