# Overview

CloudAPI is the customer-facing API that supports the Customer Portal, as well
as direct API requests from customers using either the Triton CLIs (e.g.
node-triton) or custom tooling.  CloudAPI is a REST service written in node.js,
and typically runs on the head node.  This document describes configuration and
troubleshooting for the CloudAPI service.

## Customer Documentation

For the end-user documentation, please visit
[CloudAPI documentation](./index.html).


# Layout

CloudAPI is installed in its own zone on the head node, although it is not
installed by default.  The name of the zone is usually `cloudapi0`.  Within the
cloudapi zone, the relevant software is installed under `/opt/smartdc/cloudapi`.
CloudAPI is installed as an SMF service, so log output is placed in:
`/var/svc/log/smartdc-application-cloudapi\:cloudapi-808*.log`

These paths can be easily retrieved with `svcs -L cloudapi`.

The CloudAPI configuration file lives at
`/opt/smartdc/cloudapi/etc/cloudapi.cfg`.


# SAPI Configuration

Some aspects of cloudapi are configured via the "metadata" attribute in the
"cloudapi" service (of the "sdc" application) in SAPI. This is a list of those
knobs.

**Metadata Key**                          | **Type** | **Description**
----------------------------------------- | -------  | ------------------------------------------------
CLOUDAPI_READONLY                         | Boolean  | Default false. Used to put cloudapi into read-only mode for DC maintenance.
CLOUDAPI_DATACENTERS                      | String   | The response for the 'ListDatacenters' endpoint.
CLOUDAPI_SERVICES                         | String   | The response for the 'ListServices' endpoint. See discussion below.
CLOUDAPI_PLUGINS                          | Array    | See "Plugins" section below.
CLOUDAPI_BLEEDING_EDGE_FEATURES           | Array    | See "Bleeding Edge Features" section below.
CLOUDAPI_BLEEDING_EDGE_LOGIN_WHITELIST    | Array    | See "Bleeding Edge Features" section below.
CLOUDAPI_THROTTLE_WHITELIST               | Array    | See "Throttles" section below.
CLOUDAPI_MULTIPLE_PUB_NETWORKS            | Boolean  | Default false. Whether machines can be provisioned with more than one public network.
CLOUDAPI_TEST_MODE                        | Boolean  | Default false. Disable some security checks to make testing easier.
CLOUDAPI_IGNORE_APPROVED_FOR_PROVISIONING | Boolean  | Default false. Allow provisioning for users even if they have not been given permission.
CLOUDAPI_DEFAULT_CONTAINER_BRAND          | String   | Default "joyent". The default brand for a container when one is not specified.
CLOUDAPI_DEFAULT_HVM_BRAND                | String   | Default "kvm". The default hypervisor for virtual machines.

For example, the 'docker' service could be added to CLOUDAPI_SERVICES as
follows.

    docker_endpoint="tcp://docker.coal.joyent.us:2376"
    cloudapi_svc=$(sdc-sapi /services?name=cloudapi | json -H 0.uuid)
    sapiadm get $cloudapi_svc \
        | json -e "
            svcs = JSON.parse(this.metadata.CLOUDAPI_SERVICES || '{}');
            svcs.docker = '$docker_endpoint';
            this.update = {metadata: {CLOUDAPI_SERVICES: JSON.stringify(svcs)}};
            " update \
        | sapiadm update $cloudapi_svc

## Top-Level Configuration

    {
        "port": 443,
        "certificate": "/opt/smartdc/cloudapi/ssl/cert.pem",
        "key": "/opt/smartdc/cloudapi/ssl/key.pem",
        "read_only": false,
        "datacenters": {
            "coal": "https://10.88.88.131"
        },
      ...
    }

This portion of the configuration file tells CloudAPI how to start up, and what
datacenter this instance is bound to (along with what other datacenters this
instance should redirect to).

**Field**    | **Type** | **Description**
------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------
port         | Number   | What SSL port to listen on
certificate  | String   | Path to a PEM encoded SSL certificate; can be relative to /opt/smartdc/cloudapi
key          | String   | Path to a PEM encoded private key for the SSL certificate; can be relative to /opt/smartdc/cloudapi
read_only    | Boolean  | When set to true, the API will deny all the POST/PUT/DELETE requests. Provided for review right after upgrading Triton
datacenters  | Object   | A k/v pairing of other DC's to URL's this instance should answer with


## Bleeding Edge Features

    ...
        "bleeding_edge_features": {
            "foo": true,
            "": false
        },
        "bleeding_edge_login_whitelist": {
            "admin": true,
            "": false
        }
    ...

One can define bleeding-edge features by name, and then set a whitelist of user
logins allowed to access those features. Cloudapi code before PUBAPI-816 shows
how to uses this config to guard endpoints and certain functionality. Currently
the "metadata.BLEEDING_EDGE_FEATURES" and
"metadata.BLEEDING_EDGE_LOGIN_WHITELIST" arrays on the "cloudapi" SAPI service
set the features and whitelist.


## UFDS

        "ufds": {

            "cache": {
                "size": 5000,
                "expiry": 60
            }
        },

The `ufds` config block tells CloudAPI how to communicate with UFDS, and what
cache settings to use.

        "cnapi": {
            "url": "http://10.99.99.18",
            "cache": {
                "size": 5000,
                "expiry": 300
            }
        },

## Plugins

The `plugins` section is present so that CloudAPI can perform custom actions
**before** and **after** provisioning happens in your environment, as well as
various other filtering actions that may be useful. These plugins are
dynamically loaded by CloudAPI at startup time.

An example configuration:

        "plugins": [
            {
                "name": "provision_limits",
                "enabled": false,
                "config": {
                    "defaults": [
                        {"check": "os", "os": "smartos", "value": 1},
                        {"check": "brand", "brand": "lx", "by": "ram", "value": 8192}
                    ]
                }
            }, {
                "name": "machine_email",
                "enabled": false,
                "config": {
                    "smtp": {
                        "host": "127.0.0.1",
                        "port": 25,
                        "secureConnection": false,
                        "auth": {
                            "user": "",
                            "pass": ""
                        }
                    },
                    "from": "nobody@joyent.com",
                    "subject": "Your SmartDataCenter machine is provisioning",
                    "body": "Check /my/machines for updates"
                }
            }
        ],

For information on writing a plugin, see [Plugin System](#plugin-system).
By default, CloudAPI ships with some example plugins to limit provisioning based
on number of customer machines, or resouces used by customer machines, as well
as providing a free tier of machines for customers to use.

**Field** | **Type** | **Description**
--------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------
name      | String   | Name of the plugin. Assumption is that the .js file containing the plugin is at `/opt/smartdc/cloudapi/plugins/${name}.js`
enabled   | Boolean  | Whether or not this plugin should be loaded
config    | Object   | A free-form object that gets passed into your plugin at creation time


## Throttles

CloudAPI ships with a completely configurable mechanism for rate limiting
requests from tenants.  You can throttle by IP address and by username (the
former running before authentication, the latter after).  Since the different
internal services CloudAPI protects have different scaling characteristics,
CloudAPI supports throttling each API 'endpoint' separately.  The general
syntax is explained here, rather than a complete annotation of what's in the
configuration file by default.

CloudAPI uses the [Token Bucket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket)
algorithm, and creates a separate bucket for each throttle definition. As an
example:

    "ipThrottles": {
      "all": {
        "ip": true,
        "burst": 9,
        "rate": 3,
        "overrides": {
          "10.99.99.14": {
            "burst": 0,
            "rate": 0
          }
        }
      }
    }

This configuration tells CloudAPI to create one token bucket for all endpoints,
and make it match on `ip`.  Allow a maximum burst rate of `9` requests from a
single IP (assuming there are tokens), and refill the bucket at a rate of `3`
tokens per second.  However, allow any requests coming from the portal to have
an unlimited request rate.

The given keys that can be configured in the throttling configuration:

**Key**     | **Description**
----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------
account     | /account specific throttling
audit       | /audit specific throttling
config      | /config specific throttling
datacenters | /datacenters specific throttling
datasets    | /images specific throttling (originally /datasets)
keys        | /keys specific throttling
machines    | /machines specific throttling
networks    | /networks specific throttling
nics        | /nics specific throttling
packages    | /packages specific throttling
policies    | /policies specific throttling
services    | /services specific throttling
resources   | Role tagging of resources
roles       | /roles specific throttling
users       | /users specific throttling

These configurations can live in either the `ipThrottles` or `userThrottles`
section (or both).  Note that in `ipThrottles`, the type `ip` is literally
the remote connected address, so if you have placed CloudAPI behind a load
balancer/reverse-proxy, you'll literally be throttling that device, as
opposed to the end user (which probably isn't what you want).  Instead, set
the type to `xff` to throttle on the `X-Forwarded-For` header.


# Plugin System

The plugin system (defined in `lib/plugin-manager.js`) is provided by both
CloudAPI and sdc-docker, and both have an identical interface. The plugin system
allows modifying CloudAPI (or sdc-docker) behaviour without modifying CloudAPI
itself.

This is a list of currently-supported plugin hooks. If a plugin exports a
function with the following names, it will be called by CloudAPI to modify
associated REST calls during operation.

**Hook**                 | **Description**
------------------------ | -----------------------------------------------------
allowProvision           | Determine whether a provision should be allowed to proceed.
postProvision            | Perform an action after a successful provision.
filterListNetworks       | Filter networks before returning them to a CloudAPI client.
filterGetNetworksOrPools | Similar to above, but used in a different context in sdc-docker.
findOwnerExternalNetwork | Modify which networks are selected as external, particularly during provisioning. Used in sdc-docker.

CloudAPI provides plugin hooks with the following functions and data:

**Handle**     | **Type**  | **Description**
-------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------
log            | Object    | The restify logger that will let you write into the CloudAPI SMF log
datacenterName | String    | Name of this CloudAPI instance's datacenter
service        | String    | Which service this is, in case plugin behaviour should differ between cloudapi and sdc-docker
NotAuthorizedError        | Class    | Restify's error class
getNapiNetworksForAccount | Function | Get details about networks useable by current account
getActiveVmsForAccount    | Function | Get active VMs belonging to current account
getImage                  | Function | Get the details about a particular image
listImages                | Function | Get a list of images

For details on writing a plugin, you should be familiar with
[node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [restify](https://github.com/restify/node-restify),
and the internal Triton APIs.  For a reference plugin, see
`/opt/smartdc/cloudapi/plugins/free_tier.js` or
`/opt/smartdc/cloudapi/plugins/machine_email.js`. Also see [Appendix
B](#appendix-b).

Additionally, you can require in your plugin file any of the NPM modules
available for CloudAPI/sdc-docker itself. See
`/opt/smartdc/cloudapi/package.json` for the complete list of available modules
additional to the default NodeJS set.

For more information, inspect the source code of
`/opt/smartdc/cloudapi/plugins/free_tier.js`. For a more complicated
example, see `/opt/smartdc/cloudapi/plugins/provision_limits.js`. The API itself
is documented in `/opt/smartdc/cloudapi/lib/plugin-manager.js`

An assumption is that the .js file containing a plugin with name `${name}`
is at `/opt/smartdc/cloudapi/plugins/${name}.js`. Absolute paths can also be
provided as the name, in case a custom plugin lives elsewhere on the filesystem.


# LogLevels

The logLevel sets the verbosity of debug logging in the SMF log file.  By
default, CloudAPI logs at the `info` level, which means you'll get start/stop
and error messages (in addition to request logging).  If you are encountering a
problem with CloudAPI, you'll almost certainly want the level to be set to
`debug` or `trace`.  See [Troubleshooting](#Troubleshooting) below.


# Troubleshooting

If you are seeing errors/bugs with the CloudAPI CLI, or with the reference
portal, you can turn on debug logging for CloudAPI in one of two ways (below).

First, you should check the log file by running:

    $ less `svcs -L cloudapi`

And looking for any indication of errors.  Note that CloudAPI logs some amount
of request information by default, and logs `WARN` level entries anytime there
is an error sent to the client (including if the error is user initiated). If
you cannot determine the problem from the default logs, turn on debug logging.


## Debug Logging in SMF

Log messages can be traced using `bunyan -p cloudapi` as explained in
[Bunyan DTrace Examples](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan#dtrace-examples)


# Metrics

CloudAPI exposes metrics via [node-triton-metrics](https://github.com/joyent/node-triton-metrics) on `http://<ADMIN_IP>:<config.port + 800>/metrics`. For example, if the CloudAPI servers are running on port 8081 and 8082, then a metrics server would be exposed on `http://<ADMIN_IP>:8881/metrics` and `http://<ADMIN_IP>:8882/metrics`.


# Appendix A: Provision Limits Plugin

CloudAPI comes with a **Provisioning Limits** plugin, which provides several
options for limits that CloudAPI will check before allowing the provision of a
new machine for a given customer.

Limits are either for all accounts or for a specific account. It is possible to
limit an account based on three sums: total number of account VMs, total sum of
those VMs' RAM, and/or the total sum of those VM's disk quota. Each of these
three sums can be optionally constrainted by: VM brand, VM OS (specifically, the
"os" attribute in the VM's image), and/or VM image name.

The following is the configuration fragment expected in the plugins section of
CloudAPI config file (usually set through SAPI) in order to enable and set the
different options for this plugin:


     {
          "name": "provisioning_limits",
          "enabled": true,
          "config": {
              "defaults": [{
                  "os": ${image_os} (String),
                  "image": ${image_name} (String),
                  "check": "os" | "image" (String),
                  "by": "ram" | "quota" | "machines" (String),
                  "value": ${value} (Negative Integer|Zero|Positive Integer)
              }, { ... }, ...]
          }
      }

Here are some examples of what can be added to defaults (or through UFDS,
described later):

    { "value": 200,  "by": "quota" }
    { "value": 1024, "by": "ram", "check": "os",    "os": "windows" }
    { "value": 25 }
    { "value": 100,               "check": "brand", "brand": "lx" }
    { "value": 8192, "by": "ram", "check": "image", "image": "base64-lts" }
    { "value": 50,                "check": "os",    "os": "any" }

Possible values for every config member are:

**Name**   | **Type** | **Description**         | **Possible values**
---------- | -------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------
os         | String   | Value for Image `os`.   | Usually, this will be one of `windows`, `linux`, `smartos`, `bsd` or `other`. See [IMGAPI os values](https://github.com/joyent/sdc-imgapi/blob/master/docs/index.md#manifest-os)
image      | String   | Value for Image `name`. | The name of the image. See [IMGAPI possible values for image names](https://github.com/joyent/sdc-imgapi/blob/master/docs/index.md#manifest-name)
check      | String   | Either "image" or "os"  | See explanation below
by         | String   | The name of the value this limit will be based on. Note that "machines" means "number of machines" | "ram", "quota", or "machines"
value      | Number   | A value for the previous "by" member | Negative Integer, Zero, or Positive Integer

Now the specifics.

Limit comes in the following JSON format:
    { "value": <number> }

Where <number> is either a number, or a 10-base string encoding of a number.
E.g. 10 or "10". 0 and -1 have special meanings: 0 means unlimited, and -1
prevents all matching provisions.

By default, a limit counts the number of VMs across a datacenter. So to set
the maximum number of VMs for an account across a datacenter to 25, use:
    { "value": 25 }

We can modify what the "value" counts by adding a "by" clause:
    { "value": <number>, "by": "<dimension>" }

Where currently-supported dimensions are "ram" (in MiB) or "quota" (in GiB).
It's possible to use something beyond "ram" and "quota" (e.g. "count"), but
that will be ignored and treated as the default: counting the number of VMs
across a datacenter; this is for compatibility with cloudapi's old plugin.

As an example, to limit the total amount of RAM an account can use across a
datacenter to 10240MiB, use the following limit:
    { "value": 10240, "by": "ram" }

It's possible to constrain a limit to specific VM brands, image names or
operating systems, instead of the entire datacenter. This is done with the
"check" attribute. It comes in three forms:
    { ..., "check": "brand", "brand": "<VM brand>" }
    { ..., "check": "image", "image": "<name of image>" }
    { ..., "check": "os", "os": "<name of image operating system>" }

So to limit the total amount of RAM used by VMs running Windows images to
8192MiB:
    { "value": 8192, "by": "ram", "check": "os", "os": "windows" }

You can use "any" in place of the image OS or name, or the VM brand. Like so:
    { "value" 25, "check": "image", "image": "any" }

"any" flags in "image" or "os" are commonly added by adminui, yet while "any"
is supported, its effect is the same as not using "check" in the first place.
E.g. these two are equivalent, both limiting the amount of disk used across
an entire datacenter to 900GiB:
    { "value": 900, "by": "quota", "check": "os", "os": "any" }
    { "value": 900, "by": "quota" }

Several limits can apply to the same account at once. All the examples above
were meant as one-liners, but adding several limits to an account will work
as desired. Each limit is applied to a new provision, and if any of the
limits, the provision is rejected.

As an example, to allow an account to have up to 25 VMs, a maximum of
25600MiB RAM and 2.5TiB disk across the datacenter, and specifically only
allow them to use 2048MiB RAM for the heretical penguin-loving Linux,
add the following four limits to the account:
    { "value": 25 }
    { "value": 25600, "by": "ram" }
    { "value": 2560, "by": "quota" }
    { "value": 2048, "by": "ram", "check": "os", "os": "other" }

There are two places that limits can be stored, and this is also reflected in
their use case:

1. sapi, both for sdc-docker and cloudapi. This is where default limits and
   categories of limits for large numbers of users are kept. These limits
   typically rarely change.
2. ufds, which is for individual accounts. These are used to add exceptions
   to the defaults and categories stored in sapi.

A typical use-case is to prevent all accounts from using more than a limited
amount of RAM of VMs across a datacenter, until their account has been vetted
by support (e.g. credit card number isn't fraudulent). After vetting, the
limit is bumped substantially. In this use-case, small limits would be set in
sdc-docker's and cloudapi's sapi configuration to serve as defaults. Once
support has vetted the account, they can add a limit in ufds for that account
to override the defaults, thus bumping the amount of RAM or VMs the account
can provision.

Limits are added to CloudAPI through sapi by adding a configuration for
this CloudAPI plugin:

    CLOUDAPI_UUID=$(sdc-sapi /services?name=cloudapi | json -Ha uuid)
    sdc-sapi /services/$CLOUDAPI_UUID -X PUT -d '{
        "metadata": {
            "CLOUDAPI_PLUGINS": "[{\"name\":\"provision_limits\", \
            \"enabled\": true,\"config\":{\"defaults\":[{\"value\":2 }]}}]"
        }
    }'

If you do this for cloudapi, you are strongly recommended to do the same for
sdc-docker:

    DOCKER_UUID=$(sdc-sapi /services?name=docker | json -Ha uuid)
    sdc-sapi /services/$DOCKER_UUID -X PUT -d '{
        "metadata": {
            "DOCKER_PLUGINS": "[{\"name\":\"provision_limits\", \
            \"enabled\": true,\"config\":{\"defaults\":[{\"value\":2 }]}}]"
        }
    }'

Looking at this plugin's configuration:
    { "defaults": [<limits>] }

Limits in "defaults" are applied to all provisions unless specifically
overridden with a ufds limit. Additional categories can be added in the
plugin's configuration, and their names are up to you. E.g.:

    {
        "defaults": [
            { "value": 2 },
            { "value": 1024, "by": "ram" }
        ]
        "small": [
            { "value": 20 },
            { "value": 10, "check": "brand", "brand": "kvm" },
            { "value": 327680, "by": "ram" },
            { "value": 2000, "by": "quota" }
        ]
        "whale": [
            { "value": 10000 },
            { "value": 327680000, "by": "ram" },
            { "value": 1000000, "by" :"quota" }
        ]
    }

The above configuration has defaults which are applied to all accounts that
do not have a category set in "tenant" (see below). There are two added
category of users: "small" and "whale". The "small" category allows accounts
to have up to 20 VMs, up to 10 KVM instances, and a total of 320GiB RAM and
2000GiB disk across the datacenter. The "whale" category is much, much
higher.

Which category an account falls in is determined by the "tenant" attribute on
that account in ufds. If the attribute is blank or absent (or a category
that doesn't exist in the configuration), the account uses "defaults" limits.
If the attribute is present and matches a category in the plugin
those are the limits used. For example, this account is a whale:

    $ sdc-ufds search '(login=megacorp)' | json tenant
    whale

To override any of these defaults or categories in ufds, add a capilimit
entry. It takes the general form of:

    sdc-ufds add '
    {
      "dn": "dclimit=$DATACENTER, uuid=$ACCOUNT_UUID, ou=users, o=smartdc",
      "datacenter": "$DATACENTER",
      "objectclass": "capilimit",
      "limit": ["<JSON limit>", "<JSON limit>", ...]
    }'

One last, more complete, config example:

> *Disallow provisioning any windows machine. For any other OS, allow
> provisioning machines until RAM reaches a limit of 51200.*

    "plugins": [
        {
            "name": "provision_limits",
            "enabled": true,
            "config": {
                "defaults":[{
                   "by": "ram",
                   "value": 51200
                }, {
                   "check": "os",
                   "os": "windows",
                   "value": -1
                }]
            }
        },


### Adding limits using UFDS:

The following is an example of adding provisioning limits using ufds:

    sdc-ldap add << EOD
    dn: dclimit=coal, uuid=cc71f8bb-f310-4746-8e36-afd7c6dd2895, ou=users, o=smartdc
    datacenter: coal
    objectclass: capilimit
    limit: {"os": "smartos", "check": "os", "by": "ram", "value": "8192"}
    limit: {"os": "any", "check": "os", "value": "4"}
    EOD

You can also modify existing capilimit entries. The following would modify an
entry, add some extra limits to the customer:

    sdc-ldap modify << EOD
    dn: dclimit=coal, uuid=d7425eee-bbb1-4abf-b2b8-95ac1eee832f, ou=users, o=smartdc
    changetype: modify
    add: limit
    limit: {"os": "smartos", "check": "os", "by": "ram", "value": "8192"}
    -
    add: limit
    limit: {"os": "any", "check": "os", "value": "4"}
    EOD


# Appendix B: Upgrading Plugins

For CloudAPI 8.9.0, the plugin interface was updated to a portable and more
stable interface. Plugins written to this interface are far less likely to break
as CloudAPI's internals change, and the same plugin will work in both CloudAPI
and sdc-docker.


## Configuration

Configuration of plugins has not changed, with two minor exceptions:

* capi_limits no longer exists. It has long been superceeded by the
  provision_limits plugin. If you are using capi_limits, replace capi_limits
  in your configuration and replace the names with image filters. Here is an
  example:

  capi_limits:

    "name": "capi_limits",
    "enabled": true,
    "config": {
        "datacenter": "coal",
        "defaults": {
            "smartos": 20,
            "nodejs": 25,
            "ubuntu": 15
        }
    }

  Equivalent provision_limits:

    "name": "provision_limits",
    "enabled": true,
    "config": {
        "defaults": [
            { "check": "image", "image": "smartos", "value": 20 },
            { "check": "image", "image": "nodejs",  "value": 25 },
            { "check": "image", "image": "ubuntu",  "value": 15 }
        ]
    }

* As you may have noticed in the example above, `datacenter` is no longer
  needed. CloudAPI and sdc-docker already know which datacenter they are in,
  so a `datacenter` attribute in a plugin configuration is ignored.


## Code

The changes required by most code is comparatively small. When a plugin is
initialized, it received two arguments (api and cfg) instead of the one (cfg).
`api` is the interface through which all interactions initiated by the plugin
are made to CloudAPI. `cfg` behaves as it did before.

The function signature of the function returned by the initializer function
has changed as well. The returned function used to take `req`, `res`, and
a callback; this was convenient, but unstable, subject to changing CloudAPI
internals. Now returned functions take `opts` and a callback. The `opts` passed
to a function are defined by what they do (i.e. allowProvision, postProvision,
findOwnerExternalNetwork, and other hooks that are defined in
lib/plugin-manager.js).

Old style:

    function exampleOldInitializer(cfg) {
        var defaults = cfg.defaults;
        return function oldCallback(req, res, next) {
            ...
            next();
        }
    }

New style:

    function exampleNewInitializer(api, cfg) {
        var defaults = cfg.defaults;
        return function newCallback(opts, next) {
            ...
            next();
        }
    }

Available `api` calls are listed in
[Provisioning Plugins](#provisioning-plugins). For even more detailed
information, see `lib/plugin-manager.js`.

Lastly, checking the URL and HTTP method is no longer required in a plugin.
Whereas before a plugin might be called when PUTing a machine, not just POSTing,
plugins are called within strict contexts. So something like this is now
unnecessary:

    // Do nothing if we are not provisioning (OLD STYLE)
    if (!(/\/machines$/.test(req.url) &&
        req.method.toUpperCase() === 'POST')) {
        return next();
    }

For all of this in action, see `/opt/smartos/cloudapi/plugins/free_tier.js`. It
is a simple example to understand.
