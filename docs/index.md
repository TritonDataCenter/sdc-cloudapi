# Joyent CloudAPI

CloudAPI is the public API for a SmartDataCenter cloud: it allows end users
of the cloud to manage their accounts, instances, networks, images, and to
inquire other relevant details. CloudAPI provides a single view of docker
containers, infrastructure containers and hardware virtual machines owned by
the user.

This is the reference documentation for the CloudAPI that is part of Joyent's
SmartDataCenter product.  This guide provides descriptions of the APIs
available, as well as supporting information -- such as how to use the SDK(s),
command line interface (CLI), and where to find more information.

For more information about this product visit
[Joyent SmartDataCenter](http://www.joyent.com/software/smartdatacenter).


## Conventions

Any content formatted as follows is a command-line example that you
can run from a shell:

    $ sdc-listmachines

All other examples and information are formatted like so:

    GET /my/machines HTTP/1.1




# Introduction to CloudAPI

## What is CloudAPI?

CloudAPI is the API you use to interact with the SmartDataCenter product.  Using
CloudAPI, you can:

* Provision new containers ('SmartMachines') and virtual machines
* Manage your account credentials
* Create custom analytics for monitoring your infrastructure

While CloudAPI provides the visibility into docker containers, the regular
[Docker CLI](https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation)
should be used for provisioning and managing docker containers.
(SmartDataCenter provides an endpoint that represents the entire datacenter
as a single `DOCKER_HOST`. Refer to Joyent's [Docker documentation](https://apidocs.joyent.com/docker)
for more information.)



## How do I access CloudAPI?

CloudAPI is available as a REST API, and you can access it using:

* SmartDataCenter Customer Portal
* [Command line interface](https://github.com/joyent/node-smartdc) (CLI)
* [node.js SDK](https://github.com/joyent/node-smartdc)
* REST API

If you don't want to write any code, use the CloudAPI CLI.  The CLI lets you use
command-line tools to perform every action available in the SDK and REST API.




# Getting Started

If you choose to use the CloudAPI command line interface (CLI), be aware that it
requires Node.js and npm.

You can get Node.js from [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org) as source code, and as
precompiled packages for Windows and Macintosh.  It should be greater or equal
than v0.8.14, so npm should come with it as well.

Once you've installed Node.js and npm, install the CloudAPI CLI as follows:

    $ npm install smartdc -g

You will also want to install [json](https://www.npmjs.org/package/json), a tool
that makes it easier to work with JSON-formatted output.  You can install it
like this:

    $ npm install json -g

In both cases the `-g` switch installs the tools globally, usually in
`/usr/local/bin`, so that you can use them easily from the command line.  You
can omit this switch if you'd rather the tools be installed in your home
hierachy, but you'll need to set your PATH appropriately.


## Generate an SSH key

The CloudAPI CLI does not allow you to use HTTP Basic Authentication, as that is
a weak security mechanism.  Furthermore, to interact with the provisioned
machines themselves, you need an SSH key to login.

If you haven't already generated an SSH key (required to use both SSH and HTTP
Signing), run the following command:

    $ ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa

This will prompt you with a place to save the key.  You should probably just
accept the defaults, as many programs (SSH and SDC CLI) will first look for a
file called ~/.ssh/id_rsa.


## Set Up your CLI

You need to know the following information in order to interact with CloudAPI:

* `SDC_ACCOUNT`: Your username.  The login you use for SDC.
* `SDC_USER`: The account subuser when you are using
  [Role Based Access Control](#rbac-users-roles-policies).
* `SDC_URL`: The URL of the CloudAPI endpoint.
* `SDC_KEY_ID`: Fingerprint for the key you uploaded to SmartDC through portal.

An example for `SDC_URL` is `https://us-west-1.api.joyentcloud.com`.  Each
datacenter in a cloud has its own CloudAPI endpoint; a different cloud that uses
SmartDataCenter would have a different URL.

In this document, we'll use `api.example.com` as the `SDC_URL` endpoint; please
replace it with the URL of your DC(s).  Note that CloudAPI always uses secure
HTTP, which means that the endpoint URL must begin with `https`.

You can quickly get your key fingerprint for `SDC_KEY_ID` by running:

    $ ssh-keygen -l -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d '\n'

where you obviously replace `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` with the path to the public key
you want to use for signing requests.


## Working with the CLI

For a complete list of CloudAPI CLI commands available, please see
[Appendix D: CloudAPI CLI Commands](#appendix-d-cloudapi-cli-commands).

To get help on command, use the `--help` flag.  For example:

    $ sdc-listdatacenters --help
    sdc-listdatacenters [--account string] [--debug boolean] [--help boolean] [--keyId string] [--url url]

You can set environment variables for the following flags so that you don't have
to type them for each request (e.g. in your .bash_profile).  All the examples in
this document assume that these variables have been set:

| **CLI Flags** | **Description** | **Environment Variable** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| --account<br/>-a | Login name (account) | SDC\_ACCOUNT |
| --user | Subuser name when using [Role Based Access Control](#rbac-users-roles-policies) | SDC\_USER |
| --keyId<br/>-k | Fingerprint of the key to use for signing | SDC\_KEY\_ID |
| --url<br/>-u | URL of the CloudAPI endpoint | SDC\_URL |

You can use the short form of flags as well.  For instance, you can use the `-a`
or `--account` flag.


## Provision a new machine

To provision a new machine, you first need to get the `id`s for the image and
package you want to use as the base for your machine.

An image is a snapshot of a filesystem and its software (for SmartMachines),
or a disk image (for Virtual Machines).  You can get the list of available
images using the `sdc-listimages` command; see the [ListImages](#ListImages)
section below for a detailed explanation of this command.

A package is a set of dimensions for the new machine, such as RAM and disk size.
You can get the list of available packages using the `sdc-listpackages` command;
see the [ListPackages](#ListPackages) section below for a detailed explanation
of this command.

Once you have the package and image ids, to provision a new machine:

    $ sdc-createmachine --name=getting-started --image=c3321aac-a07c-11e3-9430-fbb1cc12d1df --package=9fcd9ab7-bd07-cb3c-9f9a-ac7ec3aa934e
    {
      "id": "4adf88fb-ba7e-c4b1-a017-b988f510cbc2",
      "name": "getting-started",
      "type": "smartmachine",
      "brand": "joyent",
      "state": "provisioning",
      "image": "c3321aac-a07c-11e3-9430-fbb1cc12d1df",
      "ips": [],
      "memory": 256,
      "disk": 16384,
      "metadata": {
        "root_authorized_keys": "..."
      },
      "tags": {},
      "created": "2014-05-28T10:12:38.329Z",
      "updated": "2014-05-28T10:12:38.329Z",
      "networks": [],
      "firewall_enabled": false,
      "compute_node": null,
      "package": "g3-devtier-0.25-smartos"
    }

You can use the `--name` flag to name your machine; if you do not specify a
name, SmartDataCenter will generate one for you.  `--image` is the `id` of the
image you'd like to use as the new machine's base.  `--package` is the `id` of
the package to use to set machine dimensions.

Retrieve the status of your new machine by:

    $ sdc-listmachines --name=getting-started
    [
      {
        "id": "4adf88fb-ba7e-c4b1-a017-b988f510cbc2",
        "name": "getting-started",
        "type": "smartmachine",
        "brand": "joyent",
        "state": "running",
        "image": "c3321aac-a07c-11e3-9430-fbb1cc12d1df",
        "ips": [
          "165.225.138.124",
          "10.112.2.89"
        ],
        "memory": 256,
        "disk": 16384,
        "metadata": {
          "root_authorized_keys": "..."
        },
        "tags": {},
        "created": "2014-05-28T10:15:33.301Z",
        "updated": "2014-05-28T10:16:50.000Z",
        "networks": [
          "65ae3604-7c5c-4255-9c9f-6248e5d78900",
          "56f0fd52-4df1-49bd-af0c-81c717ea8bce"
        ],
        "primaryIp": "165.225.138.124",
        "firewall_enabled": false,
        "compute_node": "44454c4c-3800-104b-805a-b4c04f355631",
        "package": "g3-devtier-0.25-smartos"
      }
    ]

When you provision a new machine, the machine will take time to be initialized
and booted; the `state` attribute will reflect this.  Once the `state` attribute
in the JSON from `sdc-listmachines` is "running", you can login to your new
machine (assuming it's a Unix-based machine), with the following:

    $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    $ ssh -A admin@165.225.138.124

Replace `~/.ssh/id_rsa` with the path to the key you added in the portal, and
`165.225.138.124` with the IP of your new machine.

These two commands set up your SSH agent (which has some magical properties,
such as the ability for the CLI to work on your SmartMachine without keys), and
logs you in as the `admin` user on that machine.  Note that the `admin` user has
password-less sudo capabilities, so you may want to set up some less priviledged
users.  The SSH keys on your account will allow you to login as `root` or
`admin` on your SmartMachine.

Now that we've done some basics with a machine, let's introduce a few concepts:


<a name="image-description"></a>
### Images

By default, you can use SmartOS images.  Your SmartDataCenter cloud may have
other images available as well, such as Linux or Windows images.  The list of
available images can be obtained with:

    $ sdc-listimages


<a name="packages-description"></a>
### Packages

You can list packages available in your cloud with:

    $ sdc-listpackages
    [
      {
        "name": "g3-standard-8-smartos",
        "memory": 8192,
        "disk": 807936,
        "swap": 16384,
        "lwps": 2000,
        "vcpus": 0,
        "default": false,
        "id": "28d8c3f1-cf62-422a-a41d-fdf8b5110d00",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "description": "Standard 8 GB RAM 2 vCPUs and bursting 789 GB Disk",
        "group": "Standard"
      },
      ...
    ]

Packages are the SmartDataCenter name for the dimensions of your machine.
Packages are provided so that you do not need to select individual settings,
such as RAM or disk size.  To provision a new SmartMachine with more memory than
the one your created above, try:

    $ sdc-createmachine --name=big-one --image=3390ca7c-f2e7-11e1-8818-c36e0b12e58b --package=28d8c3f1-cf62-422a-a41d-fdf8b5110d00

Please note this example assumes that the package and image `id`s above exist in
the SmartDataCenter setup you are interacting with.  That may or not be the
case, given that packages and image may change from one setup to another.  Just
make sure you try the previous example with an existing package and image `id`s
from those you obtained using `sdc-listpackages` and `sdc-listimages`
respectively.


## Managing SSH keys

For machines which don't have a `brand` of `kvm` (see the JSON returned from
`sdc-listmachines`), you can manage the SSH keys that allow logging into the
machine via CloudAPI (Virtual Machines are static, and whatever keys were in
your account at machine creation time are used).  For example, to rotate keys:

    $ sdc-createkey --name=my-other-rsa-key ~/.ssh/my_other_rsa_key.pub

The `--name` option sets the name of the key.  If you don't provide one,
CloudAPI sets it to the name of the file; in this case `my_other_rsa_key.pub`.

To use the new key, you will need to update the environment variables:

    $ export SDC_KEY_ID=`ssh-keygen -l -f ~/.ssh/my_other_rsa_key.pub | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d '\n'`

At this point you could delete your other key from the system; see
[Cleaning Up](#cleaning-up) for a quick example.


## Creating Analytics

Now that you have a SmartMachine up and running, and you logged in and did
whatever it is you thought was awesome, let's create an instrumentation to
monitor performance.  Analytics are one of the most powerful features of
SmartDataCenter, so for more information, be sure to read
[Appendix B: Cloud Analytics](#appendix-b-cloud-analytics).

To get started, let's create an instrumentation on our network bytes:

    $  sdc-createinstrumentation --module=nic --stat=vnic_bytes
    {
      "module": "nic",
      "stat": "vnic_bytes",
      "predicate": {},
      "decomposition": [],
      "value-dimension": 1,
      "value-arity": "scalar",
      "enabled": true,
      "retention-time": 600,
      "idle-max": 3600,
      "transformations": {},
      "nsources": 0,
      "granularity": 1,
      "persist-data": false,
      "crtime": 1401278156130,
      "value-scope": "interval",
      "id": "1",
      "uris": [
        {
          "uri": "/.../analytics/instrumentations/1/value/raw",
          "name": "value_raw"
        }
      ]
    }

Great, now ssh back into your machine, and do something silly like:

    $ wget joyent.com
    $ ping -I 1 joyent.com

Back on your CLI, go ahead and run:

    $ sdc-getinstrumentation 1
    {
      "module": "nic",
      "stat": "vnic_bytes",
      "predicate": {},
      "decomposition": [],
      "value-dimension": 1,
      "value-arity": "scalar",
      "enabled": true,
      "retention-time": 600,
      "idle-max": 3600,
      "transformations": {},
      "nsources": 0,
      "granularity": 1,
      "persist-data": false,
      "crtime": 1401278293816,
      "value-scope": "interval",
      "id": "2",
      "uris": [
        {
          "uri": "/marsell/analytics/instrumentations/2/value/raw",
          "name": "value_raw"
        }
      ]
    }

Where `1` is the id you got back from `sdc-createinstrumentation`.  You should
be able to run this a few times and see the changes.  This is just a starting
point, for a full discussion of analytics, be sure to read
[Appendix B: Cloud Analytics](#appendix-b-cloud-analytics).


## Cleaning up

After going through this `Getting Started` section, you should now have at least
one SSH key, one machine and one instrumentation.  The rest of the commands
assume you have [json](https://www.npmjs.org/package/json) installed.

### Deleting Instrumentations

Before cleaning up your machines, let's get rid of the instrumentation we
created:

    $ sdc-deleteinstrumentation 1

### Deleting Machines

Machines need to be shutdown before you can delete them, so let's do some fancy
shell work to do that:

    $ sdc-listmachines -n getting-started | json 0.id | xargs sdc-stopmachine

Now go ahead and check the state a few times until it's `stopped`, then run
`sdc-deletemachine`:

    $ sdc-listmachines -n getting-started | json 0.state
    $ sdc-listmachines -n getting-started | json 0.id | xargs sdc-deletemachine

### Deleting keys

Finally, you probably have one or two SSH keys uploaded to SmartDataCenter after
going through the guide, so delete the one we setup:

    $ sdc-deletekey id_rsa


## RBAC: Users, Roles & Policies.

Starting at version 7.2.0, CloudAPI supports Role Based Access Control (RBAC),
which means that [accounts](#account) can have multiple users and
roles associated with them.

While the behaviour of the [main account](#GetAccount) remains the same,
including the [SSH keys](#keys) associated with it, it's now possible to have
multiple [Users](#users) subordinate to the main account.  Each of these
users have a different set of [SSH Keys](#sshKeys).  Both the users and their
associated SSH keys have the same format as the main account object (and the
keys associated with it).

It's worth mentioning that the `login` for an account's users must be different
only between the users of that account, not globally.  We could have an account
with login *"mark"*, another account "exampleOne" with a user with login "mark",
another account "exampleTwo" with another user with login "mark", and so
forth.

These account users can additionally be organized using [Roles](#roles):

    {
        id: '802fbab6-ec2b-41c3-9399-064ccb65075b',
        name: 'devs',
        members: [ 'bob', 'fred', 'pedro' ],
        default_members: [ 'bob', 'fred' ],
        policies: [ 'createMachine', 'resizeMachine', 'CreateImageFromMachine']
    }

Each role can have an arbitrary set of [Policies](#policies):

    {
        id: '9d99a799-8234-4dd8-b37d-9af14b96da25',
        name: 'restart machines',
        rules: [ 'CAN rebootmachine if requesttime::time > 07:30:00 and requesttime::time < 18:30:00 and requesttime::day in (Mon, Tue, Wed, THu, Fri)', 'CAN stopmachine', 'CAN startmachine' ],
        description: 'This is completely optional'
    }

The `rules` in policies are used for the access control of an account's users.
These rules use [Aperture](https://github.com/joyent/node-aperture) as
the policy language, and are described in detail in the next section.

Our recommendation is to limit each policy's set of rules to a very scoped
collection, and then add one or more of these policies to each group.  This aids
easily reusing existing policies for one or more roles, allowing fine-grained
definition of each role's abilities.


## Rules definition for access control

As mentioned earlier, the policies' rules use
[Aperture Policy Language](https://github.com/joyent/node-aperture#policy-language),
with the following *basic format*:

`<principals> CAN <actions> <resources> WHEN <conditions>`.

You should refer to the
[Aperture documentation](https://github.com/joyent/node-aperture) for the
complete details about the different possibilities when defining new rules.
This section will only cover a limited set strictly related to CloudAPI's usage.

In the case of CloudAPI, `<principal>` will be always the user performing the
HTTP request. Likewise, `<resource>` will always be the URL
of such request, for example `/:account/machines/:machine_id`.

We add one or more roles to a resource to explicitly define the active roles a
user trying to access a given resource must have. Therefore, we don't need to
specify `<principal>` in our rules, given it'll be always defined by the
role-tags of the resource the user is trying to get access to. For the same
reason, we don't need to specify `<resource>` in our rules.

Therefore, CloudAPI's Aperture rules have the format:

        CAN <actions> WHEN <conditions>

By default, the access policy will `DENY` any attempt made by any account
user to access a given resource, unless:

* that resource is tagged with a role
* that role is active
* that role has a policy
* that policy contains a rule which explicity `GRANTS` access to that resource

For example, a user with an active role `read`, which includes a policy rule
like `CAN listmachines and getmachines` will not get access to resources like
`/:account/machines` or `/:account/machines/:machine_id` unless these resources
are *role-tagged* with the role `read` too.

Additionally, given that the `<actions>` included in the policy rule are just
`listmachines` and `getmachine`, the user will be able to retrieve a machine's
details provided by the [GetMachine](#GetMachine) action, but will not be able
to perform any other machine actions (like [StopMachine](#StopMachine)).
However, if the role has a rule including that `<action>` (like StopMachine), or
the user has an additional role which includes that rule, then the user can
invoke that action too.

As an aside, the active roles of a user are set by the `default_members`
attribute in a role. If three different roles contain the "john" user (amongst
others) in their default-members list, then the "john" user will have those
three roles as active roles by default. This can be overridden by passing in
`?as-role=<comma-separated list of role names>` as part of the URL; provided
that each role contains that user in their `members` list, then those roles are
set as the currently-active roles for a request instead.

For more details on how Access Control works for both CloudAPI and Manta,
please refer to [Role Based Access Control][acuguide] documentation.

[acuguide]: https://docs.joyent.com/jpc/rbac/


## Managing Fabrics

A fabric is the basis for building your own private networks that
cannot be accessed by any other user. It represents the physical infrastructure
that makes up a network; however, you don't have to cable or program it. Every
account has its own unique `fabric` in every data center.

On a fabric, you can create your own VLANs and layer three IPv4 networks. You
can create any VLAN from 0-4095, and you can create any number of IPv4 networks
on top of the VLANs, with all of the traditional IPv4 private addresses spaces -
`10.0.0.0/8`, `192.168.0.0/16`, and `172.16.0.0/12` - available for use.

You can create networks on your fabrics to create most network topologies. For
example, you could create a single isolated private network that nothing else
could reach, or you could create a traditional configuration where you have a
database network, a web network, and a load balancer network, each on their own
VLAN.




# An important note about RBAC and certain reads after writes

CloudAPI uses replication and caching behind the scenes for user, role and
policy data. This implies that API reads after a write on these particular
objects can be up to several seconds out of date.

For example, when a user is created, cloudapi returns both a user object
(which is up to date), and a location header indicating where that new user
object actually lives. Following that location header may result in a 404 for
a short period.

As another example, if a policy is updated, the API call will return a policy
object (which is up to date), but GETing that URL again may temporarily return
a outdated object with old object details.

For the time being, please keep in mind that user, role and policy
creation/updates/deletion may potentially take several seconds to settle. They
have eventual consistency, not read-after-write.




# API Introduction

CloudAPI exposes a REST API over HTTPS.  You can work with the REST API by
either calling it directly via tooling you already know about (such as curl, et
al), or by using the CloudAPI SDK from Joyent.  The CloudAPI SDK is available as
an npm module, which you can install with:

    $ npm install smartdc

The rest of this document will show all APIs in terms of both the raw HTTP
specification, the SDK API, and the CLI command.


## Issuing Requests

All HTTP calls to CloudAPI must be made over SSL/TLS, and requests must carry at
least two headers (in addition to standard HTTP headers): `Authorization` and
`Api-Version` header.  The details are explained below.  In addition to these
headers, any requests requiring content must be sent in an acceptable scheme to
CloudAPI.  Details are also below.

### Content-Type

For requests requiring content, you can send parameters encoded with
`application/json`, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or
`multipart/form-data`.  Joyent recommends `application/json`.  The value of the
`Accept` header determines the encoding of content returned in responses.
CloudAPI supports `application/json` response encodings only.

For example, all of the following are valid calls:

Query String (on the uri):

    POST /my/keys?name=rsa&key=... HTTP/1.1
    Host: joyent.com
    Authorization: ...
    Content-Length: 0

Form encoded in the body:

    POST /my/keys HTTP/1.1
    Host: joyent.com
    Authorization: ...
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    Content-Length: 123

    name=rsa&key=...

JSON in the body:

    POST /my/keys HTTP/1.1
    Host: joyent.com
    Authorization: ...
    Content-Type: application/json

    {"name":"rsa","key":"..."}

### Authorization

All API calls to CloudAPI require an Authorization header, which supports
multiple ["schemes"](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617).  Currently CloudAPI
supports only one Authentication mechanism due to PCI compliance restrictions:

* HTTP Signature Authentication Scheme.  This Scheme is outlined in
[Appendix C](#Appendix-C).

In order to leverage HTTP Signature Authentication, only RSA signing mechanisms
are supported, and your keyId must be equal to the path returned from a
[ListKeys](#ListKeys) API call.  For example, if your SmartDataCenter login is
`demo`, and you've uploaded an RSA SSH key with the name `foo`, an Authorization
header would look like:

    Authorization: Signature keyId=/demo/keys/foo,algorithm="rsa-sha256" ${Base64($Date)}

The default value to sign for CloudAPI requests is simply the value of the HTTP
`Date` header.  For more informaton on the Date header value, see
[RFC 2616](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.18).  All requests to
CloudAPI using the Signature authentication scheme *must* send a Date header.
Note that clock skew will be enforced to within 300 seconds (positive or
negative) from the value sent.

Full support for the HTTP Signature Authentication scheme is in the CloudAPI
SDK; an additional reference implementation for Node.js is available in the npm
`http-signature` module, which you can install with:

    npm install http-signature@0.9.11

### Api-Version

CloudAPI is strongly versioned, and all requests *must* specify a version of
the API.  The `Api-Version` header is expected to contain a
[semver](http://semver.org/) string describing the API version the client wants
to use, with the additional twist that your client can specify ranges of
versions it supports, much like you can with npm.  For details on how to specify
ranges, check [node-semver](https://github.com/isaacs/node-semver).  A couple
examples:

    Api-Version: ~8.0
    Api-Version: >=7.0.0

Joyent recommends you set the Api-Version header to `~8.0`; each service
release of SmartDataCenter will increment the `patch` version; any major
releases of SmartDataCenter will increment either the `minor` or `major`
version.

### Using cURL with CloudAPI

Since [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/) is commonly used to script requests to web
services, here's a simple function you can use to wrap cURL when communicating
with CloudAPI:

    $ function cloudapi() {
      local now=`date -u "+%a, %d %h %Y %H:%M:%S GMT"` ;
      local signature=`echo ${now} | tr -d '\n' | openssl dgst -sha256 -sign ~/.ssh/id_rsa | openssl enc -e -a | tr -d '\n'` ;

      curl -is -H "Accept: application/json" -H "api-version: ~8.0" -H "Date: ${now}" -H "Authorization: Signature keyId=\"/demo/keys/id_rsa\",algorithm=\"rsa-sha256\" ${signature}" --url https://api.example.com$@ ;
      echo "";
    }

With that function, you could just do:

    $ cloudapi /my/machines


## CloudAPI HTTP Responses

Like mentioned above, CloudAPI returns all response objects as
`application/json` encoded HTTP bodies.  In addition to the JSON body, all
responses have the following headers:

| **Header** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Date | When the response was sent (RFC 1123 format) |
| Api-Version | The exact version of the CloudAPI server you spoke with |
| Request-Id | A unique id for this request; you should log this |
| Response-Time | How long the server took to process your request (ms) |

If there is content, you can expect:

| **Header** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Content-Length | How much content, in bytes |
| Content-Type | Formatting of the response (almost always application/json) |
| Content-MD5 | An MD5 checksum of the response; you should check this |

### HTTP Status Codes

Your client should check for each of the following status codes from any API
request:

| **Response** | **Code** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | Bad Request | Invalid HTTP Request |
| 401 | Unauthorized | Either no Authorization header was sent, or invalid credentials were used |
| 403 | Forbidden | No permissions to the specified resource |
| 404 | Not Found | Something you requested was not found |
| 405 | Method Not Allowed | Method not supported for the given resource |
| 406 | Not Acceptable | Try sending a different Accept header |
| 409 | Conflict | Most likely invalid or missing parameters |
| 413 | Request Entity Too Large | You sent too much data |
| 415 | Unsupported Media Type | You encoded your request in a format we don't understand |
| 420 | Slow Down | You're sending too many requests |
| 449 | Retry With | Invalid Version header; try with a different Api-Version string |
| 503 | Service Unavailable | Either there's no capacity in this datacenter, or we're in a maintenance window |

### Error Responses

In the event of an error, CloudAPI will return a standard error response object
in the body with the scheme:

    {
      "code": "CODE",
      "message": "human readable string"
    }

Where the code element is one of:

| **Code** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| BadRequest | You sent bad HTTP |
| InternalError | Something was wrong on our end |
| InUseError | The object is in use and cannot be operated on |
| InvalidArgument | You sent bad arguments or a bad value for an argument |
| InvalidCredentials | Try authenticating correctly |
| InvalidHeader | You sent a bad HTTP header |
| InvalidVersion | You sent a bad Api-Version string |
| MissingParameter | You didn't send a required parameter |
| NotAuthorized | You don't have access to the requested resource |
| RequestThrottled | You were throttled |
| RequestTooLarge | You sent too much request data |
| RequestMoved | HTTP Redirect |
| ResourceNotFound | What you asked for wasn't found |
| UnknownError | Something completely unexpected happened |

Clients are expected to check HTTP status code first, and if it's in the 4xx
range, they can leverage the codes above.

# Keys

This part of the API is the means by which you operate on your SSH/signing keys.
These keys are needed in order to login to machines over SSH, as well as signing
requests to this API (see the HTTP Signature Authentication Scheme outlined in
[Appendix C](#Appendix-C) for more details).

Currently CloudAPI supports uploads of public keys in the OpenSSH format.

Note that while it's possible to provide a `name` attribute for an SSH key, in
order to use it as an human-friendly alias, this attribute's presence is
completely optional.  When it's not provided, the ssh key fingerprint will be
used as the `name` instead.

On the following routes, the parameter placeholder `:key` can be replaced with
with either the key's `name` or its `fingerprint`.  It's strongly recommended to
use `fingerprint` when possible, since the `name` attribute does not have
uniqueness constraints.


## ListKeys (GET /:login/keys)

| --- | --- |
|  PrepareImageDidNotRun  |  This typically means that the target KVM machine (e.g. Linux) has old guest tools that pre-date the image creation feature. Guest tools can be upgraded with installers at <https://download.joyent.com/pub/guest-tools/>. Other possibilities are: a boot time greater than the five-minute timeout, or a bug or crash in the image-preparation script.  |
|  VmHasNoOrigin  |  Origin image data could not be found for the machine. Typically this is for a machine *migrated* before image creation support was added.  |
|  NotSupported   |  Indicates an error due to functionality that isn't currently supported. One example is that custom image creation of a VM based on a custom image isn't currently supported.  |
|  InternalError  |  A catch-all error for unexpected or internal errors.  |

## ExportImage (POST /:login/images/:id?action=export)

Exports an image to the specified Manta path.  One must be the owner of the
image and the correspondent Manta path prefix in order to export it.  Both the
image manifest and the image file will be exported, and their filenames will
default to the following format when the specified manta path is a directory:

    <manta_path>/NAME-VER.imgmanifest
    <manta_path>/NAME-VER.zfs.FILE-EXT

Where NAME is the image name and VER is the image version.  FILE-EXT is the file
extension of the image file.  As an example, exporting a foo-1.0.0 image to
/user/stor/cloudapi would result in the following files being exported:

    /user/stor/cloudapi/foo-1.0.0.imgmanifest
    /user/stor/cloudapi/foo-1.0.0.zfs.gz

By contrast, if the basename of the given prefix is not a directory, then
"MANTA_PATH.imgmanifest" and "MANTA_PATH.zfs[.EXT]" are created.  As an example,
the following shows how to export foo-1.0.0 with a custom name:

    /my/images/<uuid>?action=export&manta_path=/user/stor/my-image

    /user/stor/my-image.imgmanifest
    /user/stor/my-image.zfs.gz

### Inputs

| **Field**  | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| manta_path | String | The Manta path prefix to use when exporting the image. |

### Returns

A Manta location response object.  It provides the properties that allow a
CloudAPI user to retrieve the image file and manifest from Manta: manta_url,
image_path, manifest_path.

### Errors

For all possible errors, see [CloudAPI HTTP Responses](#cloudapi-http-responses).

# Machines

## ListMachines (GET /:login/machines)

Lists all machines we have on record for your account.  If you have a large
number of machines, you can filter using the input parameters listed below.

You can paginate this API by passing in `offset` and `limit`.  HTTP responses
will contain the additional headers `x-resource-count` and `x-query-limit`.  If
`x-resource-count` is less than `x-query-limit`, you're done, otherwise call the
API again with `offset` set to `offset` + `limit` to fetch additional machines.

Note that there is a `HEAD /:login/machines` form of this API, so you can
retrieve the number of machines without retrieving a JSON describing the
machines themselves.

### Inputs

| type | String | (deprecated)The type of machine (virtualmachine or smartmachine) |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| brand | String | (8.0+)The type of machine (e.g. lx) |
| name | String | Machine name to find (will make your list size 1, or 0 if nothing found) |
| image | String | Image id; returns machines provisioned with that image |
| state | String | The current state of the machine (e.g. running) |
| memory | Number | The current size of the RAM deployed for the machine (in MiB) |
| tombstone | Number | Include machines destroyed in the last N minutes |
| limit | Number | Return a max of N machines; default is 1000 (which is also the maximum allowable result set size) |
| offset | Number | Get a `limit` number of machines starting at this `offset` |
| tag.$name | String | An arbitrary set of tags can be used for querying, assuming they are prefixed with "tag." |
| credentials | Boolean | Whether to include the generated credentials for machines, if present. Defaults to false. |

Note that if the special input `tags=*` is provided, any other input will be
completely ignored and the response will return all machines with any tag.

### Returns

An array of machine objects, which contain:

| id | String | Unique identifier for this machine |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| name | String | The "friendly" name for this machine |
| type | String | (deprecated)The type of machine (virtualmachine or smartmachine) |
| brand | String | (8.0+)The type of machine (e.g. lx) |
| state | String | The current state of this machine (e.g. running) |
| memory | Number | The amount of RAM this machine has (in MiB) |
| disk | Number | The amount of disk this machine has (in MiB) |
| ips | Array[String] | The IP addresses this machine has |
| metadata | Object[String => String] | Any additional metadata this machine has |
| created | Date (ISO8601) | When this machine was created |
| updated | Date (ISO8601) | When this machine was last updated |
| package | String | The id or name of the package used to create this machine |
| image | String | The image id this machine was provisioned with |
| docker | Boolean | Whether this machine is a Docker container, if present |

## CreateMachine (POST /:login/machines)

Allows you to provision a machine.

If you do not specify a name, CloudAPI will generate a random one for you.

> **NOTE:**<br />
CreateMachine no longer returns IP addresses as of SDC 7.0.  To obtain the IP
address of a newly-provisioned machine, poll [ListMachines](#ListMachines) or
[GetMachine](#GetMachine) until the machine state is `running` or a failure.

Your machine will initially be not available for login (SmartDataCenter must
provision and boot it); you can poll [GetMachine](#GetMachine) for status.
When the `state` field is equal to `running`, you can log in. If the machine is
a brand other than `kvm`, you can usually use any of the SSH keys managed under
the [keys section](#keys) of CloudAPI to login as any POSIX user on the OS.
You can add/remove keys over time, and the machine will automatically work with
that set.

If the the machine has a brand `kvm`, and of a UNIX-derived OS (e.g. Linux),
you *must* have keys uploaded before provisioning; that entire set of keys will
be written out to `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`, and you can SSH in using one of
those.  Changing the keys over time under your account will not affect a
running virtual machine in any way; those keys are statically written at
provisioning-time only, and you will need to manually manage them on the machine
itself.

If the image you create a machine from is set to generate passwords for you,
the username/password pairs will be returned in the metadata response as a
nested object, like:

    "metadata": {
      "credentials": {
        "root": "s8v9kuht5e",
        "admin": "mf4bteqhpy"
      }
    }

You cannot overwrite the `credentials` key in CloudAPI.

More generally, the metadata keys can be set either at machine-creation time
or after the fact.  You must either pass in plain-string values, or a JSON
encoded string.  On metadata retrieval, you will get back a JSON object.

Networks can be specified using the networks attribute. If it is absent from
the input, the machine will default to attaching to one externally-accessible
network (it will have one public IP), and one internally-accessible network from
the datacenter network pools. It is possible to have a machine only attached
to an internal network, or both public and internal, or just external.
NB: 'internal' cannot be reached from the Internet, but all users also on the
internal network can reach it.

Typically, SDC will allocate the new machine somewhere reasonable within the
cloud.  You may want this machine to be placed close to, or far away from, other
existing machines belonging to you;  if so, you can provide locality hints to
cloudapi.  Locality hints are not guarantees, unless `strict` is set true,
but SDC will attempt to satisfy the hints if possible. An example of a locality
hint is:

    "locality": {
      "strict": false,
      "near": ["af7ebb74-59be-4481-994f-f6e05fa53075"],
      "far": ["da568166-9d93-42c8-b9b2-bce9a6bb7e0a", "d45eb2f5-c80b-4fea-854f-32e4a9441e53"]
    }

UUIDs provided should be the ids of machines belonging to you.

Locality hints are optional. Both `near`, `far`, and `strict` are also optional;
you can provide just one if desired. Lastly, if there's only a single UUID entry
in an array, you can omit the array and provide the UUID string directly as the
value to a near/far key.

`strict` defaults to false if not provided. If `strict` is provided and is true,
the creation of the new machine will fail if the provided `near` and/or `far`
cannot be met. `near` will try to place the new machine on the same server as
the given machine UUIDs, otherwise in the same rack; it will fail if no space
can be found in that rack. `far` will try to place the new machine in a
different, otherwise a different server in the same rack; it will fail if space
can only be found on the same server as the given machine UUIDs.


### Inputs

| name | String | Friendly name for this machine; default is the first 8 characters of the machine id |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| package | String | Id of the package to use on provisioning, obtained from [ListPackages](#ListPackages) |
| image | String | The image UUID (the "id" field in [ListImages](#ListImages)) |
| networks | Array | Desired networks ids, obtained from [ListNetworks](#ListNetworks) |
| locality | Object[String => Array] | Optionally specify which machines the new machine should be near or far from |
| metadata.$name | String | An arbitrary set of metadata key/value pairs can be set at provision time, but they must be prefixed with "metadata." |
| tag.$name | String | An arbitrary set of tags can be set at provision time, but they must be prefixed with "tag." |
| firewall_enabled | Boolean | (Added in CloudAPI 7.0.) Completely enable or disable firewall for this machine. Default is false. |

### Returns

## ResizeMachine (POST /:login/machines/:id?action=resize)

Resize a machine to a new [package](#packages) (a.k.a. instance type).

Resizing is only supported for non-KVM machines (machines which are not
`brand=kvm`, also known as 'zones').  KVM virtual machines (`brand=kvm`) cannot
be resized.

Resizing is not guaranteed to work, especially when resizing upwards in
resources. It is best-effort, and may fail. Resizing downwards will usually
succeed.

### Inputs

| action | String | Use the exact string "resize" |
| --- | --- | --- |
| package | String | A package id, as returned from [ListPackages](#ListPackages) |

### Returns

* None

### Errors

For all possible errors, see [CloudAPI HTTP Responses](#cloudapi-http-responses).

| **Error Code** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| ResourceNotFound | If `:login` or `:id` does not exist |
| InvalidState | The machine is in the wrong state to be resized |
| InvalidArgument | If `action` was invalid, or `package` wasn't a valid id or name |

## CreateMachineSnapshot (POST /:login/machines/:id/snapshots)

Allows you to take a snapshot of a machine.  Once you have one or more
snapshots, you can boot the machine from a previous snapshot.

Snapshots are not usable with other machines; they are a point in time snapshot
of the current machine. Snapshots can also only be taken of machines that are
*not* of brand 'kvm'.

Since SmartMachines use a copy-on-write filesystem, snapshots take up increasing
amounts of space as the filesystem changes over time. There is a limit to how
much space snapshots are allowed to take. Plan your snapshots accordingly.

You can poll on [GetMachineSnapshot](#GetMachineSnapshot) until the `state` is
`success`.

### Inputs

| name | String | The name to assign to the new snapshot |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------------------------ |

### Returns

| name | String | The name of this snapshot |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| state | String | The current state of the snapshot |

### Errors

For all possible errors, see [CloudAPI HTTP Responses](#cloudapi-http-responses).

| **Error Code** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| ResourceNotFound | If `:login` or `:id` does not exist |
| InvalidArgument | If `name` was invalid |

## AddMachineTags (POST /:login/machines/:id/tags)

Allows you to add additional tags, other than those set at provisioning time.
This API lets you *append* new tags, not overwrite existing tags.

This call allows you to send any number of parameters; all of these will be
converted into tags on the machine that can be used for searching later.

### Inputs

| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $tagName | String | You can assign any number of tags in this call |

### Returns

Returns the current set of tags.

| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $tagName | String | Your value |

### Errors

For all possible errors, see [CloudAPI HTTP Responses](#cloudapi-http-responses).

# Analytics

It is strongly recommended that before you read the API documentation for
Analytics, you first read through
[Appendix B: Cloud Analytics](#appendix-b-cloud-analytics). Most supporting
documentation and explanation of types and interactions are described there.


## DescribeAnalytics (GET /:login/analytics)

Supports retrieving the "schema" for instrumentations which can be created using
the analytics endpoint.

### Inputs

* None

### Returns

A large object that reflects the analytics available to you.

Each of the items listed below is an object; the keys in each are what can be
used. For example, in 'modules', you'll get something like:

    {
      "modules": {
        "cpu": { "label": "CPU" },
        "memory": { "label": "Memory" },
        ...
      },
      "fields": {
        "hostname": {
          "label": "server hostname",
          "type": "string"
        },
        "runtime": {
          "label": "time on CPU",
          "type": "time"
        },
        "zonename": {
          "label": "zone name",
          "type": "string"
        }
      },
      "types": {
        "string": {
          "arity": "discrete",
          "unit": ""
        },
        "size": {
          "arity": "numeric",
          "unit": "bytes",
          "abbr": "B",
          "base": 2,
        },
        "time": {
          "arity": "numeric",
          "unit": "seconds",
          "abbr": "s",
          "base": 10,
          "power": -9,
        }
      },
      "metrics": [ {
        "module": "cpu",
        "stat": "thread_executions",
        "label": "thread executions",
        "interval": "interval",
        "fields": [ "hostname", "zonename", "runtime" ],
        "unit": "operations"
      }, {
        "module": "memory",
        "stat": "rss",
        "label": "resident set size",
        "interval": "point",
        "fields": [ "hostname", "zonename" ],
        "type": "size"
      } ],
      "transformations": {
        "geolocate": {
          "label": "geolocate IP addresses",
          "fields": [ "raddr" ]
        },
        "reversedns": {
          "label": "reverse dns IP addresses lookup",
          "fields": [ "raddr" ]
        }
      }
    }

You can use `cpu`, `memory` as module parameters to the other APIs.

| **Field** | **Type** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| modules | Object |
| fields | Object |
| types | Object |
| metrics | Object |
| transformations | Object |

Each of these objects is discussed below:

#### Modules

Each metric is identified by both a `module` and `stat` name.  Modules exist
as namespaces to organize metrics.  A module configuration looks like this:

    "modules": {
      "cpu": {
        "label": "CPU" },
        "memory": { "label": "Memory" },
        ...
      }

Each module has a name (its key in the "modules" structure), and an object with
a single field called `label`, which is its human-readable label.

#### Metrics

Metrics describe quantities which can be measured by the system.  Data is not
collected for metrics unless an instrumentation has been configured for it.

    "metrics": [ {
      "module": "cpu",
      "stat": "thread_executions",
      "label": "thread executions",
      "interval": "interval",
      "fields": [ "hostname", "zonename", "runtime" ],
      "unit": "operations"
    }, {
      "module": "memory",
      "stat": "rss",
      "label": "resident set size",
      "interval": "point",
      "fields": [ "hostname", "zonename" ],
      "type": "size"
    } ]

Each metric has the following properties:

| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| module | String | With stat, a unique metric identifier |
| stat | String | With module, a unique metric identifier |
| label | String | A human-readable metric description |
| interval | String | either "interval" or "point", indicating whether the value of this metric covers activity over an *interval* of time or a snapshot of state at a particular *point* in time |
| fields | Array | a list of fields to be used for predicates and decompositions |
| type | String | type or unit used to display labels for values of this metric |

#### Fields
| --- | --- | --- |

Fields represent metadata by which data points can be filtered or decomposed.
| --- | --- | --- |

    "fields": {
      "pid": {
        "label": "process identifier",
        "type": "string"
      },
      "execname": {
        "label": "application name",
        "type": "string"
      },
      "psargs": {
        "label": "process arguments",
        "type": "string"
      },
      ...

Each field has the following properties:

| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| label | String | human-readable description of the field |
| type | String | type of the field, which determines how to label it, as well as whether the field is numeric or discrete |

Fields are either numeric or discrete based on the "arity" of their type.
| --- | --- | --- |

###### Numeric fields

* In predicates, values of numeric fields can be compared using numeric equality
  and inequality operators (=, <, >, etc).
* In decompositions, a numeric field yields a numeric decomposition (see
  "Numeric decompositions" above).

###### Discrete fields

* In predicates, values of discrete fields can only be compared using string
  equality.
* In decompositions, a discrete field yields a discrete decomposition (see
  "Discrete decompositions" above).

Note that some fields look like numbers but are used by software as identifiers,
and so are actually discrete fields.  Examples include process identifiers,
which are numbers, but don't generally make sense comparing using inequalities
or decomposing to get a numeric distribution.

#### Types

Types are used with both metrics and fields for two purposes: to hint to clients
at how to best label values, and to distinguish between numeric and discrete
quantities.

    "types": {
      "string": {
        "arity": "discrete",
        "unit": ""
      },
      "size": {
        "arity": "numeric",
        "unit": "bytes",
        "abbr": "B",
        "base": 2,
      },
      "time": {
        "arity": "numeric",
        "unit": "seconds",
        "abbr": "s",
        "base": 10,
        "power": -9,
       }
     }

Each type has the following properties:

| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| arity | String | indicates whether values of this type are "discrete" (e.g. identifiers and other strings), or "numeric" (e.g. measurements) |
| unit | String | base unit for this type |
| abbr | String | (optional) abbreviation for this base unit for this type |
| base | Number | indicates that when labeled, this quantity is usually labeled with SI prefixes corresponding to powers of the specified base |
| power | Number | this indicates that the raw values of this type are expressed in units corresponding to base raised to power |

#### Transformations

Transformations are post-processing functions that can be applied to data when
it's retrieved.

    "transformations": {
      "geolocate": {
        "label": "geolocate IP addresses",
        "fields": [ "raddr" ]
      },
      "reversedns": {
        "label": "reverse dns IP addresses lookup",
        "fields": [ "raddr" ]
      }
    }

Each transformation has the following properties:

| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| label | String | Human-readable string |
| fields | Array | List of field names that can be transformed |

The above transformations transform values of the "raddr" (remote address) field
of any metric to either an object with geolocation details, or an array of
reverse-DNS hostnames, respectively.

# FirewallRules

You can manage Firewall Rules for your machines through CloudAPI.


## Firewall Rule Syntax

In general, the firewall rule is composed of the following pieces:

    FROM <target a> TO <target b> <action> <protocol> <port>

where `target` can be one of `wildcard`, `ip`, `subnet`, `tag` or `vm`, `action`
is either `ALLOW` or `BLOCK`, `protocol` will be one of `tcp`, `udp` and `icmp`,
and `port` is a valid port number.

The rule should have `tag` or `vm` in the FROM or TO target. The following are some possibilities:

### Allow incoming http traffic to a VM:

    {
        "enabled": true,
        "rule": "FROM any TO vm 0abeae82-c040-4080-ac60-b60d3e3890a7 ALLOW tcp port 80"
    }

### Block outgoing SMTP traffic from a VM to a subnet:

    {
        "enabled": true,
        "rule": "FROM vm 0abeae82-c040-4080-ac60-b60d3e3890a7 TO subnet 10.99.99.0/24 BLOCK tcp port 25"
    }

### Allow an IP HTTP and HTTPS access to all VMs tagged www or testwww:

    {
        "enabled": true,
        "rule": "FROM ip 10.99.99.7 TO (tag www OR tag testwww) ALLOW tcp (port 80 AND port 443)"
    }

### Allow syslog traffic from VMs tagged with group=web to VMs tagged with group=mon:

    {
        "enabled": true,
        "rule": "FROM tag group=www TO tag group=mon ALLOW udp port 514"
    }


## ListFirewallRules (GET /:login/fwrules)

## AddNic (POST /:login/machines/:id/nics)

Creates a new NIC on a machine belonging to a given account.

*WARNING*: this causes the machine to reboot while adding the NIC.

### Inputs

| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| network | String | UUID of network this NIC should attach to |

### Returns

The newly-created NIC object:

| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ip  | String | NIC's IPv4 address |
| mac | String | NIC's MAC address |
| primary | Boolean | Whether this is the VM's primary NIC |
| netmask | String | IPv4 netmask |
| gateway | String | IPv4 gateway |
| state | String | Describes the state of the NIC (most likely 'provisioning') |

It also returns the Location in the headers where the new NIC lives in the HTTP
API. If a NIC already exists for that network, a 302 redirect will be returned
instead of the object.

NICs do not appear on a machine immediately, so the state of the new NIC can be
checked by polling that location. While the NIC is provisioning, it will have a
`state` of 'provisioning'. Once it's 'running', the NIC is active on the
machine. If the provision fails, the NIC will be removed and the location will
start returning 404.

### Errors

For all possible errors, see [CloudAPI HTTP Responses](#cloudapi-http-responses).

| **Error Code** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| ResourceNotFound | If `:login` or `:id` does not exist |
| InvalidArgument | If `:id` isn't a UUID, or the `network` argument isn't a valid UUID |
| MissingParameter | If the `network` argument isn't present |

## RemoveNic (POST /:login/machines/:id/nics/:mac)

Removes a NIC on a machine belonging to a given account.

Like [AddNic](#AddNic) above, the NIC won't be removed from the machine
immediately. After the NIC is removed, it will start returning 404 through
CloudAPI.

*WARNING*: this causes the machine to reboot while removing the NIC.

# Appendix A: Machine States

## Machine State Diagram

The following is the state diagram for a machine:

<pre>
          POST /my/machines
                     |
                     |
                     V
          +----------------+
          |  Provisioning  |
          +----------------+
                     |
                     |
                     V
          +----------------+
    +---->|     Running    |
    |     +----------------+
    |                |
    |                | action=stop
    |                V
    |     +----------------+
    |     |    Stopping    |
    |     +----------------+
    |                |
    | action=start   |
    |                V
    |     +----------------+
    +---- |     Stopped    |
          +----------------+
                     |
                     | DELETE
                     V
          +----------------+
          |  Deleted       |---+
          +----------------+   |
                               |
                              ---
                               -

</pre>

At any point the state can also be `offline`, like if there is a network or
power event to the machine.

Since version 7.0 of this API, `failed` is used to signify a failed provision.


## Polling machine state

As suggested in [CreateMachine](#CreateMachine), you can poll a machine's state
to check when that machine's provisioning has either successfully completed or
failed.  Consider the following code using
[node.js SDK](https://github.com/joyent/node-smartdc):

    var sdc = smartdc.createClient({ ... });

    function checkMachineStatus(id, state, callback) {
        return sdc.getMachine(id, function (err, machine) {
            if (err) {
                if (err.statusCode === 410 && state === 'deleted') {
                    return callback(null, true);
                }
                return callback(err);
            }

            if ((machine.state === 'deleted' && state !== 'deleted')  |
                machine.state === 'failed') {
                return callback(new Error('Provisioning Job failed'));
            }

            return callback(null, (machine ? machine.state === state : false));
        }, true);
    }


    function waitForMachine(id, state, callback) {
        return checkMachineStatus(id, state, function (err, ready) {
            if (err) {
                return callback(err);
            }
            if (!ready) {
                return setTimeout(function () {
                    waitForMachine(id, state, callback);
                }, (process.env.POLL_INTERVAL  |  2500));
            }
            return callback(null);
        });
    }

With this code, you can poll when a machine with a given uuid is running by
doing:

    var machine = 'd19432ff-d921-4d6c-b5f9-6b0e4de6665c';
    waitForMachine(machine, 'running', function (err) {
        if (err) {
            console.error('Exiting because machine provisioning failed');
            process.exit(1);
        }

        // ... do your stuff here, the machine is running now ...
    });


## Polling machine audit

There are some cases where polling for machine state change will not work
because there won't be a state change for the requested action (e.g. "rename"),
or because the state change is short-lived thus making the transition easy to
miss (e.g. "reboot").

In such cases, consider polling a machine's historical of actions available
through a machine's [Machine Audit](#MachineAudit), wait for the desired
action to appear on that list, and check successfulness there.  Taking our
example from previous section, this is how we could check for a reboot:

    function checkMachineAction(id, action, time, cb) {
        return sdc.getMachineAudit(id, function (err, actions) {
            if (err) {
                return cb(err);
            }

            var acts = actions.filter(function (a) {
                return (a.action === action && (new Date(a.time) > time));
            });

            if (acts.length === 0) {
                return cb(null, false);
            }

            var act = acts[0];
            if (act.success !== 'yes') {
                return cb(action + ' failed');
            }

            return cb(null, true);  // success!
        }, true);
    }


    function waitForAction(id, action, time, cb) {
        console.log('Waiting for machine \'%s\' %s to complete',
                id, action);

        return checkMachineAction(id, action, time, function (err, ready) {
            if (err) {
                return cb(err);
            }

            if (!ready) {
                return setTimeout(function () {
                    waitForAction(id, action, time, cb);
                }, (process.env.POLL_INTERVAL  |  2500));
            }
            return cb(null);
        });
    }

With this code, you can poll when a machine with a given uuid has rebooted by
doing:

    waitForAction(machine, 'reboot', (new Date()), function (err) {
        if (err) {
            // .. something failed
        } else {
            // ...all good, reboot happened successfully and machine is running
        }
    });




# Appendix B: Cloud Analytics

Cloud Analytics (CA) provides deep observability for systems and applications in
a SmartDataCenter cloud.  The CA service enables you to dynamically instrument
systems in the cloud to collect performance data that can be visualized in
real-time (through the portal), or collected using the API and analyzed later by
custom tools.  This data can be collected and saved indefinitely for capacity
planning and other historical analysis.


## Building blocks: metrics, instrumentations, and fields

A **metric** is any quantity that can be instrumented using CA.  For examples:

* Disk I/O operations
* Kernel thread executions
* TCP connections established
* MySQL queries
* HTTP server operations
* System load average

Each metric also defines which **fields** are available when data is collected.
These fields can be used to filter or decompose data.  For example, the Disk I/O
operations metric provides the fields "hostname" (for the current server's
hostname) and "disk" (for the name of the disk actually performing an
operation), which allows users to filter out data from a physical server or
break out the number of operations by disk.

You can list the available metrics using the
[DescribeAnalytics](#DescribeAnalytics) API. E.g.:

    {
      "metrics": [
        {
          "module": "fs",
          "stat": "logical_ops",
          "label": "logical filesystem operations",
          "interval": "interval",
          "fields": ["pid","execname",...,"fstype","optype","latency"],
          "unit": "operations"
        }, ...  ], ...
    }

The `module` and `stat` properties together identify a metric.

When you want to actually gather data for a metric, you create an
**instrumentation**.  The instrumentation specifies:

* which metric to collect
* an optional **predicate** based on the metric's fields (e.g. only collect
  data from certain hosts, or data for certain operations)
* an optional **decomposition** based on the metric's fields (e.g. break down
  the results by server hostname)
* how frequently to aggregate data (e.g. every second, every hour, etc.)
* how much data to keep (e.g. 10 minutes' worth, 6 months' worth, etc.)
* other configuration options

Continuing the above example, if the system provides the metric "FS Operations"
with fields "optype" and "latency", an example instrumentation might specify:

* to collect data for the "FS Operations" metric (the *metric*)
* to collect only data for read operations (a *predicate*)
* to break out the results by latency (a *decomposition*)

    $ sdc-createinstrumentation --module=fs --stat=logical_ops --decomposition=latency --predicate='{"eq": ["optype","read"]}'

When we create an instrumentation, the system dynamically instruments the
relevant software and starts gathering data.  The data is made available
immediately in real-time.  To get the data for a particular point in time, you
retrieve the **value** of the instrumentation for that time:

    $ sdc-getinstrumentation --value 4
    {
      "value": [
        [ [ 17000, 17999 ], 12 ],
        [ [ 18000, 18999 ], 12 ],
        ...
      ],
      "transformations": {},
      "start_time": 1309383598,
      "duration": 1,
      "nsources": 1,
      "minreporting": 1,
      "requested_start_time": 1309383598,
      "requested_duration": 1,
      "requested_end_time": 1309383599
    }

To summarize: *metrics* define what data the system is capable of reporting.
*Fields* enhance the raw numbers with additional metadata about each event that
| --- | --- | --- |
can be used for filtering and decomposition.  *Instrumentations* specify which
metrics to actually collect, what additional information to collect from each
metric, and how to store that data.  When you want to retrieve that data, you
query the service for the *value* of the instrumentation.


## Values and visualizations

We showed above how fields can be used to decompose results.  Let's look at that
in more detail.  We'll continue using the "FS Operations" metric with
fields "optype".

### Scalar values

Suppose we create an instrumentation with no filter and no decomposition.  Then
the value of the instrumentation for a particular time interval might look
something like this:

    {
      start_time: 1308789361,
      duration: 1,
      value: 573
      ...
    }

In this case, `start_time` denotes the start of the time interval in Unix time,
`duration` denotes the length of the interval in seconds, and `value` denotes
the actual value.  This means that 573 FS operations completed on all
systems for a user in the cloud between times 1308789361 and 1308789362.

### Discrete decompositions

Now suppose we create a new instrumentation with a decomposition by `execname`.
Then the raw value might look something like this:

    {
      start_time: 1308789361,
      duration: 1,
      value: {
        ls: 1,
        cat: 49,
        ...
      }
      ...
    }

We call the decomposition by `execname` a **discrete decomposition** because the
possible values of execname ("ls", "cat", ...) are not numbers.

### Numeric decompositions

It's useful to decompose some metrics by numeric fields.  For example, you might
want to view FS operations decomposed by latency (how long the operation
took).  The result is a statistical *distribution*, which groups nearby
latencies into buckets and shows the number of disk I/O operations that fell
into each bucket. The result looks like this:

    {
      "start_time": 1308863061,
      "duration": 1,
      "value": [
        [ [ 53000, 53999 ], 4 ],
        [ [ 54000, 54999 ], 4 ],
        [ [ 55000, 55999 ], 7 ],
        ...
        [ [ 810000, 819999 ], 1 ]
      ]
    }

That data indicates that at time 1308863061, the system completed:

* 4 requests with latency between 53 and 54 microseconds,
* 4 requests with latency between 54 and 55 microseconds,
* 7 requests between 55 and 56 microseconds, and so on, and finally
* 1 request with latency between 810 and 820 microseconds.

This type of instrumentation is called a **numeric decomposition**.

### Combining decompositions

It's possible to combine a single discrete and numeric decomposition to produce
an object mapping discrete key to numeric distribution, whose value looks like
this:

    {
      "start_time": 1308863799,
      "duration": 1,
      "value": {
        "ls": [
          [ [ 110000, 119999 ], 1 ],
          [ [ 120000, 129999 ], 1 ],
          ...
          [ [ 420000, 429999 ], 1 ],
          [ [ 25000000, 25999999 ], 1 ]
        ]
      }
    }

As we will see, this data allows clients to visualize the distribution of I/O
latency, and then highlight individual programs in the distribution (or whatever
field you broke it down along).

### Value-related properties

We can now explain several of the instrumentation properties shown previously:

* `value-dimension`: the number of dimensions in returned values, which is
  the number of decompositions specified in the instrumentation, plus 1.
  Instrumentations with no decompositions have dimension 1 (scalar values).
  Instrumentations with a single discrete or numeric decomposition have value 2
  (vector values).  Instrumentations with both a discrete and numeric
  decomposition have value 3 (vector of vectors).
* `value-arity`: describes the format of individual values
    * `scalar`: the value is a scalar value (a number)
    * `discrete-decomposition`: the value is an object mapping discrete keys to
      scalars
    * `numeric-decomposition`: the value is either an object (really an array of
      arrays) mapping buckets (numeric ranges) to scalars, or an object mapping
      discrete keys to such an object.  That is, a numeric decomposition is one
      which contains at the leaf a distribution of numbers.

The arity serves as a hint to visualization clients: scalars are typically
rendered as line or bar graphs, discrete decompositions are rendered as stacked
or separate line or bar graphs, and numeric decompositions are rendered as
heatmaps.

### Predicate Syntax

Predicates allow you to filter out data points based on the *fields* of a
metric.  For example, instead of looking at FS operations for your whole
cloud, you may only care about operations with latency over 100ms, or on a
particular machine.

Predicates are represented as JSON objects using an LISP-like syntax.  The
primary goal for predicate syntax is to be very easy to construct and parse
automatically, making it easier for people to build tools to work with them.

The following leaf predicates are available:

`{ eq: [ fieldname, value ] }`: equality (string or number, as appropriate).
`{ ne: [ fieldname, value ] }`: inequality (string or number, as appropriate).
`{ le: [ fieldname, value ] }`: less than or equal to (numbers only).
`{ lt: [ fieldname, value ] }`: less than (numbers only).
`{ ge: [ fieldname, value ] }`: greater than or equal to (numbers only).
`{ gt: [ fieldname, value ] }`: greater than (numbers only).

Additionally, the following compound predicates are available:

`{ and: [ predicate, ... ] }`: all of subpredicates must be true.
`{ or: [ predicate, ... ] }`: at least one of subpredicates must be true.

All of these can be combined to form complex filters for drilling down.  For
example, this predicate:

    {
      and: {
        { eq: [ "execname", "mysqld" ] }
        { gt: [ "latency", 100000000 ] },
        { or: [
          { eq: [ "hostname", "host1" ] },
          { eq: [ "hostname", "host2" ] },
          { eq: [ "hostname", "host3" ] }
        ] },
      }
    }

This predicate could be used with the "logical filesystem operations" metric to
identify file operations performed by MySQL on machines "host1", "host2", or
"host3" that took longer than 100ms.

### Heatmaps

Up to this point we have been showing **raw values**, which are JSON
representations of the data exactly as gathered by Cloud Analytics. However, the
service may provide other representations of the same data.  For numeric
decompositions, the service provides several **heatmap** resources that generate
heatmaps, like this one:

<img src="media/img/heatmap.png" />

Like raw values, heatmap values are returned using JSON, but instead of
specifying a `value` property, they specify an `image` property whose contents
are a base64-encoded PNG image.  For details, see the API reference.  Using the
API, it's possible to specify the size of the image, the colors used, which
values of the discrete decomposition to select, and many other properties
controlling the final result.

Heatmaps also provide a resource for getting the details of a particular heatmap
bucket, which looks like this:

    {
      "start_time": 1308865184,
      "duration": 60,
      "nbuckets": 100,
      "width": 600,
      "height": 300,
      "bucket_time": 1308865185,
      "bucket_ymin": 10000,
      "bucket_ymax": 19999,
      "present": {
        "ls": 5,
        "cat": 57
      },
      "total": 1,
    }

This example indicates the following about the particular heatmap bucket we
clicked on:

* the time represented by the bucket is 1308865185
* the bucket covers a latency range between 10 and 20 microseconds
* at that time and latency range, program `ls` completed 5 operations and
  program `cat` completed 57 operations.

This level of detail is critical for understanding hot spots or other patterns
in the heatmap.


## Data granularity and data retention

By default, CA collects and saves data each second for ten minutes.  So if you
create an instrumentation for FS operations, the service will save the
per-second number of FS operations going back for the last ten minutes.  These
parameters are configurable using the following instrumentation properties:

* `granularity`: how frequently to aggregate data, in seconds.  The default is
  one second.  For example, a value of 300 means to aggregate every five
  minutes' worth of data into a single data point.  The smaller this value, the
  more space the raw data takes up.  `granularity` cannot be changed after an
  instrumentation is created.
* `retention-time`: how long, in seconds, to keep each data point.  The default
  is 600 seconds (ten minutes).  The higher this value, the more space the raw
  data takes up.  `retention-time` can be changed after an instrumentation is
  created.

These values affect the space used by the instrumentation's data.  For example,
all things being equal, the following all store the same amount of data:

* 10 minutes' worth of per-second data (600 data points)
* 50 minutes' worth of per-5-second data
* 25 days' worth of per-hour data
* 600 days' worth of per-day data

The system imposes limits on these properties so that each instrumentation's
data cannot consume too much space.  The limits are expressed internally as a
number of data points, so you can adjust granularity and retention-time to match
your needs.  Typically, you'll be interested in either per-second data for live
performance analysis, or an array of different granularities and retention-times
for historical usage patterns.


## Data persistence

By default, data collected by the CA service is only cached in memory, not
persisted to disk.  As a result, transient failures of the underlying CA service
instances can result in loss of the collected data.  For live performance
analysis, this is likely not an issue, since the likelihood of a crash is low
and the data can probably be collected again.  For historical data being kept
for days, weeks, or even months, it's necessary to persist data to disk.  This
can be specified by setting the `persist-data` instrumentation property to
"true".  In that case, CA will ensure that data is persisted at approximately
the `granularity` interval of the instrumentation, but no more frequently than
every few minutes.  (For that reason, there's little value in persisting an
instrumentation whose retention time is only a few minutes.)


## Transformations

Transformations are post-processing functions that can be applied to data when
it's retrieved.  You do not need to specify transformations when you create an
instrumentation; you need only specify them when you retrieve the value.
Transformations map values of a discrete decomposition to something else.  For
example, a metric that reports HTTP operations decomposed by IP address supports
a transformation that performs a reverse-DNS lookup on each IP address so that
you can view the results by hostname instead.  Another transformation maps IP
addresses to geolocation data for displaying incoming requests on a world map.

Each supported transformation has a name, like "reversedns".  When a
transformation is requested for a value, the returned value includes a
`transformations` object with keys corresponding to each transformation (e.g.,
"reversedns").  Each of these is an object mapping keys of the discrete
decomposition to transformed values.  For example:

    {
      "value": {
        "8.12.47.107": 57
      },
      "transformations": {
        "reversedns": {
          "8.12.47.107": [ "joyent.com" ]
        }
      },
      "start_time": 1308863799,
      "duration": 1,
      "nsources": 1,
      "minreporting": 1,
      "requested_start_time": 1308863799,
      "requested_duration": 1,
      "requested_end_time": 1308863800
    }

Transformations are always performed asynchronously and the results cached
internally for future requests.  So the first time you request a transformation
like "reversedns", you may see no values transformed at all.  As you retrieve
the value again, the system will have completed the reverse-DNS lookup for
addresses in the data and they will be included in the returned value.




# Appendix C: HTTP Signature Authentication

In addition to HTTP Basic Authentication, CloudAPI supports a new mechanism for
authenticating HTTP requests based on signing with your SSH private key.
Specific examples of using this mechanism with SDC are given here. Reference the
`HTTP Signature Authentication` specification by Joyent, Inc. for complete
details.

A node.js library for HTTP Signature is available with:

    $ npm install http-signature@0.9.11


## CloudAPI Specific Parameters

The `Signature` authentication scheme is based on the model that the client must
authenticate itself with a digital signature produced by the private key
associated with an SSH key under your account (see `/my/keys` above).  Currently
only RSA signatures are supported.  You generate a signature by signing the
value of the HTTP `Date` header.

As an example, assuming that you have associated an RSA SSH key with your
account, called 'rsa-1', the following request is what you would send for a
`ListMachines` request:

    GET /my/machines HTTP/1.1
    Host: api.example.com
    Date: Sat, 11 Jun 2011 23:56:29 GMT
    Authorization: Signature keyId="/demo/keys/rsa-1",algorithm="rsa-sha256" <Base64(rsa(sha256($Date)))>
    Accept: application/json
    Api-Version: ~8.0

Where the signature is attached with the
`Base64(rsa(sha256(Sat, 11 Jun 2011 23:56:29 GMT)))` output.  Note that the
`keyId` parameter **cannot** use the *my* shortcut, as in the HTTP resource
paths. This is because CloudAPI must lookup your account to resolve the key, as
with Basic authentication.  In short, you **MUST** use the login name associated
to your account to specify the `keyId`.


## Sample Code

Sample code for generating the `Authorization` header (and `Date` header):

    var crypto = require('crypto');
    var fs = require('fs');
    var https = require('https');



    /**
     * Simply pads a number < 10 with a leading 0.
     *
     * @param {String} val a numeric string.
     * @return {String} a new value that may have a leading 0.
     */
    function pad(val) {
      if (parseInt(val, 10) < 10)
        val = '0' + val;
      return val;
    }


    /**
     * Generates an RFC 1123 compliant Date String
     *
     * @return {String} RFC 1123 date string.
     */
    function httpDate() {
      var now = new Date();
      var months = ['Jan',

      return days[now.getUTCDay()] + ', ' +

                  months[now.getUTCMonth()] + ' ' +
                  now.getUTCFullYear() + ' ' +
                  pad(now.getUTCHours()) + ':' +
                  pad(now.getUTCMinutes()) + ':' +
                  pad(now.getUTCSeconds()) +
                  ' GMT';
    }

    var file = process.env.HOME + '/.ssh/id_rsa';

      throw new Error(file + ' was not a valid RSA key');

# Appendix E: SDC Changelog

* Starting with version 7.0, there isn't a `default` image.  For backward
compatibility purposes, when a request using `~6.5` is received, the latest
version of the `smartos` image will become the default one.

* Starting with version 7.0, virtual machines can also be resized, but **only
resizing virtual machines to a higher capacity/package is supported**.

* Starting with version 7.0, packages listed by GET `/:account/packages` accept
search filters.  Additionally, the package members `vcpus`, `id` and `version`
are included on packages, as explained in the
[packages section](#packages-description).

* Starting with version 7.0, a historical list of actions performed on machines
is available through request `GET /:account/machines/:id/audit`.

* Starting with version 7.0, customers can manage Firewall Rules through the
`/:account/fwrules` resource, as explained in the
[Firewall Rules section](#FirewallRules).

* Starting with version 7.0, `GET /:account` exposes account details, and allows
the modification of account properties -- with the exception of `password` and
`login` -- through `POST /:account`.  Details are explained in the
[Account section](#Account)

* Starting with version 7.0, networks details are exposed through the
`/:account/networks` resource, as explained in the
[Networks section](#Networks).

* Starting with version 7.0,  node-smartdc's `sdc-createmachine` accepts an
optional `--networks|-w` argument, which can be set to the `id` of one or more
of the networks retrieved from `/:account/networks`.

* Starting with version 7.1.0, customer image management is made available,
allowing [Machine Creation from Images](#CreateImageFromMachine),
[exporting images to the specified manta path](#ExportImage) and
[custom images deletion](#DeleteImage).

* Version 7.1.0 now adds the listing and manipulation of NICs on VMs.

* Starting with version 7.1.1, firewall rules will include information regarding
rules being global or not, and will optionally include a human-readable
description for the rules (which can be modified except for the global rules).

* Starting with version 7.2.0, RBAC has been made available on the CloudAPI
interface. Accounts can create users, rules can be created and combined to make
policies, policies and users can be associated together using roles, and role
tags can be applied to CloudAPI resources.

* Version 7.3.0 adds support for network fabrics (software-defined networking).
This allows the creation of virtuan LANs and layer-three networks.

* Version 8.0.0 adds a `brand` attribute to VMs, which is more granular than the
existing `type` (now deprecated), and a `docker` boolean attribute as well,
which indicates whether a machine is a Docker container or not. The version also
makes a breaking change to the attribute `type` on images.
ListDatasets/GetDataset have been removed. The deprecated 6.5 API support, and
most related 6.5-isms, have been removed. The `default` attribute on packages is
deprecated, since it only had meaning in 6.5.
